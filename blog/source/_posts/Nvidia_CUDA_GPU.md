There are several microarchitecture stages for Nvidia GPU which support CUDA, they are: [Tesla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_%28microarchitecture%29), [Fermi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_%28microarchitecture%29), [Kepler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_%28microarchitecture%29), [Maxwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_%28microarchitecture%29), [Pascal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce#PASCAL). All these microarchitectures tart from Tesla are [Unified Shading Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_shader_model)
And, here is the [list of Nvidia GPUs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nvidia_graphics_processing_units)

##Tesla
    Before Tesla, Nvidia's GPU is based on fixed-pipeline microarchitectures. Tesla is the first microarchitecture to implement [unified shaders model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_shader_model). It was used with GeForce 8 Series, GeForce 9 Series, GeForce 100 Series, GeForce 200 Series, and GeForce 300 Series of GPUs manufactured in 90 nm, 80 nm, 65 nm, and 55 nm. It also found use in the GeForce 405, and in the workstation market in the Quadro FX, Quadro x000, Quadro NVS series, and Nvidia Tesla computing modules.
