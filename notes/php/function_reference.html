	    <ul>

		<li> Extensions to other language
		<ul>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.lua.html">Lua</a></strong> — <small>"Lua is a powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language." This extension embeds the lua interpreter and offers an OO-API to lua variables and functions. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>E&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.java.html">Java</a>;</strong> — <small>PHP / Java Integration. There are two possible ways to bridge PHP and Java: you can either integrate PHP into a Java Servlet environment, which is the more stable and efficient solution, or integrate Java support into PHP. The former is provided by a SAPI module that interfaces with the Servlet server, the latter by this Java extension. The Java extension provides a simple and effective means for creating and invoking methods on Java objects from PHP. The JVM is created using JNI, and everything runs in-process. </small></li>
		    <br>
		</ul>
		</li>


		<li> Compiler & runtime cache
		<ul>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>E&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.bcompiler.html">bcompiler</a></strong> — <small>PHP bytecode Compiler</small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.apc.html">APC</a></strong> — <small>The Alternative PHP Cache (APC) is a free and open opcode cache for PHP. Its goal is to provide a free, open, and robust framework for caching and optimizing PHP intermediate code. </small></li>
		    <br>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li> Interact with PHP engine
		<ul>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.info.html">PHP Options/Info</a></strong> — <small>PHP Options and Information. This functions enable you to get a lot of information about PHP itself, e.g. runtime configuration, loaded extensions, version and much more. You'll also find functions to set options for your running PHP. The probably best known function of PHP - phpinfo() - can be found here. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.tokenizer.html">Tokenizer</a></strong> — <small>The tokenizer functions provide an interface to the PHP tokenizer embedded in the Zend Engine. Using these functions you may write your own PHP source analyzing or modification tools without having to deal with the language specification at the lexical level. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.inclued.html">inclued</a></strong> — <small>Inclusion hierarchy viewer. Traces through and dumps the hierarchy of file inclusions and class inheritance at runtime. The files may have been included using include, include_once, require, or require_once. Class inheritance dependencies are also reported. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.xhprof.html">Xhprof</a></strong> — <small>Hierarchical Profiler
			<ul>
			    <li>XHProf is a light-weight hierarchical and instrumentation based profiler. During the data collection phase, it keeps track of call counts and inclusive metrics for arcs in the dynamic callgraph of a program. It computes exclusive metrics in the reporting/post processing phase, such as wall (elapsed) time, CPU time and memory usage. A functions profile can be broken down by callers or callees. XHProf handles recursive functions by detecting cycles in the callgraph at data collection time itself and avoiding the cycles by giving unique depth qualified names for the recursive invocations.</li>
			    <li>XHProf includes a simple HTML based user interface (written in PHP). The browser based UI for viewing profiler results makes it easy to view results or to share results with peers. A callgraph image view is also supported.</li>
			    <li>XHProf reports can often be helpful in understanding the structure of the code being executed. The hierarchical nature of the reports can be used to determine, for example, what chain of calls led to a particular function getting called.</li>
			    <li>XHProf supports ability to compare two runs (a.k.a. "diff" reports) or aggregate data from multiple runs. Diff and aggregate reports, much like single run reports, offer "flat" as well as "hierarchical" views of the profile.</li>
			</ul>
		    </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.parsekit.html">Parsekit</a></strong> — <small>These functions allow runtime analysis of opcodes compiled from PHP scripts. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.runkit.html">runkit</a></strong> — <small>The runkit extension provides means to modify constants, user-defined functions, and user-defined classes. It also provides for custom superglobal variables and embeddable sub-interpreters via sandboxing. This package is meant as a feature added replacement for the classkit package. When compiled with the --enable-runkit=classkit option to ./configure, it will export classkit compatible function definitions and constants. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.memtrack.html">Memtrack</a></strong> — <small>The purpose of this extension is to detect the most memory hungry scripts and functions. memtrack tracks memory consumption in PHP scripts and produces reports (warnings) when the consumption reaches certain levels set by the user. This is achieved by replacing default executor function by a special function which compares memory usage before and after running the original executor - this way we can tell how much the memory usage has changed during the execution of the current part of the code. Zend Engine runs its executor for each opcode array (op_array), which usually means function, plain script and such, so memtrack doesn't have any noticeable effect on performance. memtrack doesn't provide any functions, there are only INI directives which allow you to configure the way it should work. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>D&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.classkit.html">Classkit</a></strong> — <font style="background-color:white;color:grey"><small>These functions allow the dynamic manipulation of PHP classes, at runtime. This extension has been replaced by runkit, which is not limited to class manipulation but has function manipulation, as well. </small></font></li>
		    <br>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Affecting PHP's Behaviour ---- Error & Debug
		<ul>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.errorfunc.html">Error Handling</a></strong> — <small>These are functions dealing with error handling and logging. They allow you to define your own error handling rules, as well as modify the way the errors can be logged. This allows you to change and enhance error reporting to suit your needs. With the logging functions, you can send messages directly to other machines, to an email (or email to pager gateway!), to system logs, etc., so you can selectively log and monitor the most important parts of your applications and websites. The error reporting functions allow you to customize what level and kind of error feedback is given, ranging from simple notices to customized functions returned during errors. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.apd.html">APD</a></strong> — <small>APD is the Advanced PHP Debugger. It was written to provide profiling and debugging capabilities for PHP code, as well as to provide the ability to print out a full stack backtrace. APD supports interactive debugging, but by default it writes data to trace files. It also offers event based logging so that varying levels of information (including function calls, arguments passed, timings, etc.) can be turned on or off for individual scripts. APD is a Zend Extension, modifying the way the internals of PHP handle function calls, and thus may or may not be compatible with other Zend Extensions (for example Zend Optimizer). </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.scream.html">scream</a></strong> — <small>Break the silence operator. The scream extension gives the possibility to disable the silencing error control operator so all errors are being reported. This feature is controlled by an ini setting.</small></li>
		    <br>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br>

		<li>Process Control Extensions
		<ul>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.exec.html">Program execution</a></strong> — <small>System program execution. Those functions provide means to execute commands on the system itself, and means to secure such commands. All execution functions call the commands through cmd.exe under Windows. Therefore the user calling these functions needs appropriate privilege to run this command. The only exception is proc_open() with bypass_shell option.</small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.pcntl.html">PCNTL</a></strong> — <small>Process Control. Process Control support in PHP implements the Unix style of process creation, program execution, signal handling and process termination. Process Control should not be enabled within a web server environment and unexpected results may happen if any Process Control functions are used within a web server environment. //This documentation is intended to explain the general usage of each of the Process Control functions. For detailed information about Unix process control you are encouraged to consult your systems documentation including fork(2), waitpid(2) and signal(2) or a comprehensive reference such as Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment by W. Richard Stevens (Addison-Wesley). //PCNTL now uses ticks as the signal handle callback mechanism, which is much faster than the previous mechanism. This change follows the same semantics as using "user ticks". You use the declare() statement to specify the locations in your program where callbacks are allowed to occur. This allows you to minimize the overhead of handling asynchronous events. In the past, compiling PHP with pcntl enabled would always incur this overhead, whether or not your script actually used pcntl. //There is one adjustment that all pcntl scripts prior to PHP 4.3.0 must make for them to work which is to either to use declare() on a section where you wish to allow callbacks or to just enable it across the entire script using the new global syntax of declare(). </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.posix.html">POSIX</a></strong> — <small>This module contains an interface to those functions defined in the IEEE 1003.1 (POSIX.1) standards document which are not accessible through other means. Sensitive data can be retrieved with the POSIX functions, e.g. posix_getpwnam() and friends. None of the POSIX function perform any kind of access checking when safe mode is enabled. It's therefore strongly advised to disable the POSIX extension at all (use --disable-posix in your configure line) if you're operating in such an environment.</small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.sem.html">Semaphore</a></strong> — <small>Semaphore, Shared Memory and IPC. This module provides wrappers for the System V IPC family of functions. It includes semaphores, shared memory and inter-process messaging (IPC). //Semaphores may be used to provide exclusive access to resources on the current machine, or to limit the number of processes that may simultaneously use a resource. //This module provides also shared memory functions using System V shared memory. Shared memory may be used to provide access to global variables. Different httpd-daemons and even other programs (such as Perl, C, ...) are able to access this data to provide a global data-exchange. Remember, that shared memory is NOT safe against simultaneous access. Use semaphores for synchronization. //#Limits of Shared Memory by the Unix OS: #SHMMAX max size of shared memory, normally 131072 bytes; #SHMMIN 	minimum size of shared memory, normally 1 byte; #SHMMNI 	max amount of shared memory segments on a system, normally 100; #SHMSEG	max amount of shared memory segments per process, normally 6. The messaging functions may be used to send and receive messages to/from other processes. They provide a simple and effective means of exchanging data between processes, without the need for setting up an alternative using Unix domain sockets. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.shmop.html">Shared Memory</a></strong> — <small>Shmop is an easy to use set of functions that allows PHP to read, write, create and delete Unix shared memory segments. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.eio.html">Eio</a></strong> — <small>This extension provides asyncronous POSIX I/O by means of libeio C library.</small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.expect.html">Expect</a></strong> — <small>This extension allows to interact with processes through PTY. You may consider using the expect:// wrapper with the filesystem functions which provide a simpler and more intuitive interface. </small></li> 
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.libevent.html">Libevent</a></strong> — <small>Libevent is a library that provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. </small></li>
		    <br>
		</ul>
		</li>

		---------------------------------------

		<li>Variable and Type Related Extensions
		<ul>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.filter.html">Filter</a></strong> — <small>Data Filtering. This extension filters data by either validating or sanitizing it. This is especially useful when the data source contains unknown (or foreign) data, like user supplied input. For example, this data may come from an HTML form. There are two main types of filtering: validation and sanitization. Validation is used to validate or check if the data meets certain qualifications. For example, passing in FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL will determine if the data is a valid email address, but will not change the data itself. Sanitization will sanitize the data, so it may alter it by removing undesired characters. For example, passing in FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL will remove characters that are inappropriate for an email address to contain. That said, it does not validate the data. Flags are optionally used with both validation and sanitization to tweak behaviour according to need. For example, passing in FILTER_FLAG_PATH_REQUIRED while filtering an URL will require a path (like /foo in http://example.org/foo) to be present. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.array.html">Arrays</a></strong> — <small>These functions allow you to interact with and manipulate arrays in various ways. Arrays are essential for storing, managing, and operating on sets of variables. Simple and multi-dimensional arrays are supported, and may be either user created or created by another function. There are specific database handling functions for populating arrays from database queries, and several functions return arrays. Please see the Arrays section of the manual for a detailed explanation of how arrays are implemented and used in PHP. See also Array operators for other ways how to manipulate the arrays. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.var.html">Variable handling</a></strong> — <small>For information on how variables behave, see the Variables entry in the Language Reference section of the manual. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.funchand.html">Function Handling</a></strong> — <small>These functions all handle various operations involved in working with functions.</small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.classobj.html">Classes/Objects</a></strong> — <small>Class/Object Information. These functions allow you to obtain information about classes and instance objects. You can obtain the name of the class to which an object belongs, as well as its member properties and methods. Using these functions, you can find out not only the class membership of an object, but also its parentage (i.e. what class is the object class extending). </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.reflection.html">Reflection</a></strong> — <small>PHP 5 comes with a complete reflection API that adds the ability to reverse-engineer classes, interfaces, functions, methods and extensions. Additionally, the reflection API offers ways to retrieve doc comments for functions, classes and methods. Please note that certain parts of the internal API are missing the necessary code to work with the Reflection extension. E.g., an internal PHP class might be missing reflection data for properties. These few cases are considered bugs, however, so they should be discovered and fixed. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.ctype.html">Ctype</a></strong> — <small>Character type checking. The functions provided by this extension check whether a character or string falls into a certain character class according to the current locale (see also setlocale()). // When called with an integer argument these functions behave exactly like their C counterparts from ctype.h. It means that if you pass an integer smaller than 256 it will use the ASCII value of it to see if it fits in the specified range (digits are in 0x30-0x39). If the number is between -128 and -1 inclusive then 256 will be added and the check will be done on that. //When called with a string argument they will check every character in the string and will only return TRUE if every character in the string matches the requested criteria. When called with an empty string the result will always be TRUE in PHP little than 5.1 and FALSE since 5.1. //Passing anything else but a string or integer will return FALSE immediately. //It should be noted that ctype functions are always preferred over regular expressions, and even to some equivalent "str_*" and "is_*" functions. This is because of the fact that ctype uses a native C library and thus processes significantly faster. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>E&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.objaggregation.html">Object Aggregation</a></strong> — <small>Object Aggregation/Composition [PHP 4]. In Object Oriented Programming, it is common to see the composition of simple classes (and/or instances) into a more complex one. This is a flexible strategy for building complicated objects and object hierarchies and can function as a dynamic alternative to multiple inheritance. There are two ways to perform class (and/or object) composition depending on the relationship between the composed elements: Association and Aggregation. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.judy.html">Judy</a></strong> — <small>Judy Arrays. PHP Judy is a PECL extension for the Judy C library implementing dynamic sparse arrays. //A Judy array is a complex but very fast associative array data structure for storing and looking up values using integer or string keys. Unlike normal arrays, Judy arrays may be sparse; that is, they may have large ranges of unassigned indices. //A Judy array consumes memory only when populated yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory. Judy's key benefits are: scalability, performance, memory efficiency, and ease of use. Judy arrays are designed to grow without tuning into the peta-element range, scaling near O(log-base-256) -- 1 more RAM access at 256 X population. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>D&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.overload.html">Object overloading</a></strong> — <small>Object property and method call overloading. The purpose of this extension is to allow overloading of object property access and method calls. Only one function is defined in this extension, overload() which takes the name of the class that should have this functionality enabled. The class named has to define appropriate methods if it wants to have this functionality: __get(), __set() and __call() respectively for getting/setting a property, or calling a method. This way overloading can be selective. Inside these handler functions the overloading is disabled so you can access object properties normally. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.weakref.html">Weakref</a></strong> — <small>Weak references provide a non-intrusive gateway to ephemeral objects. Unlike normal (strong) references, weak references do not prevent the garbage collector from freeing that object. For this reason, an object may be destroyed even though a weak reference to that object still exists. In such conditions, the weak reference seamlessly becomes invalid. </small></li>

		<li>PHP Basic Extensions
		<ul>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.stream.html">Streams</a></strong> — <small>
<ul>
<li>Streams were introduced with PHP 4.3.0 as a way of generalizing file, network, data compression, and other operations which share a common set of functions and uses. In its simplest definition, a stream is a resource object which exhibits streamable behavior. That is, it can be read from or written to in a linear fashion, and may be able to fseek() to an arbitrary locations within the stream.</li>
<li>A wrapper is additional code which tells the stream how to handle specific protocols/encodings. For example, the http wrapper knows how to translate a URL into an HTTP/1.0 request for a file on a remote server. There are many wrappers built into PHP by default (See Supported Protocols and Wrappers), and additional, custom wrappers may be added either within a PHP script using stream_wrapper_register(), or directly from an extension using the API Reference in Working with streams. Because any variety of wrapper may be added to PHP, there is no set limit on what can be done with them. To access the list of currently registered wrappers, use stream_get_wrappers().</li>
<li>A stream is referenced as: scheme://target</li>
<ul>
    <li>scheme(string) - The name of the wrapper to be used. Examples include: file, http, https, ftp, ftps, compress.zlib, compress.bz2, and php. See Supported Protocols and Wrappers for a list of PHP built-in wrappers. If no wrapper is specified, the function default is used (typically file://).</li>
    <li>target - Depends on the wrapper used. For filesystem related streams this is typically a path and filename of the desired file. For network related streams this is typically a hostname, often with a path appended. Again, see Supported Protocols and Wrappers for a description of targets for built-in streams.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Information on using streams within the PHP source code can be found in the <a href="php-chunked-xhtml/internals2.ze1.streams.html">Streams API for PHP Extension Authors reference.</a> </li>

		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.spl.html">SPL</a></strong> — <small>Standard PHP Library. SPL is a collection of interfaces and classes that are meant to solve standard problems. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.spl-types.html">SPL Types</a></strong> — <small>SPL Type Handling. This extension aims at helping people making PHP a stronger typed language and can be a good alternative to scalar type hinting. It provides different typehandling classes as such as integer, float, bool, enum and string </small></li>

		<li>File System Related Extensions
		<ul>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.filesystem.html">Filesystem</a></strong> — <small>No external libraries are needed to build this extension, but if you want PHP to support LFS (large files) on Linux, then you need to have a recent glibc and you need compile PHP with the following compiler flags: -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:black;color:white">C</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.dir.html">Directories</a></strong> — <small></small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>D&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.mime-magic.html">Mimetype</a></strong> — <small>This extension has been deprecated as the PECL extension Fileinfo provides the same functionality (and more) in a much cleaner way. The functions in this module try to guess the content type and encoding of a file by looking for certain magic byte sequences at specific positions within the file. While this is not a bullet proof approach the heuristics used do a very good job. This extension is derived from Apache mod_mime_magic, which is itself based on the file command maintained by Ian F. Darwin. See the source code for further historic and copyright information. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.fileinfo.html">Fileinfo</a></strong> — <small>File Information. The functions in this module try to guess the content type and encoding of a file by looking for certain magic byte sequences at specific positions within the file. While this is not a bullet proof approach the heuristics used do a very good job. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.xattr.html">xattr</a></strong> — <small>The xattr extension allows for the manipulation of extended attributes on a filesystem. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.xdiff.html">xdiff</a></strong> — <small>xdiff extension enables you to create and apply patch files containing differences between different revisions of files. this extension supports two modes of operation - on strings and on files, as well as two different patch formats - unified and binary. unified patches are excellent for text files as they are human-readable and easy to review. for binary files like archives or images, binary patches will be adequate choice as they are binary safe and handle non-printable characters well. starting from version 1.5.0 there are two different sets of functions for generating binary patches. new functions - xdiff_string_rabdiff() and xdiff_file_rabdiff() generate output compatible with older functions but are typically faster and generate smaller results. for more details about methods of generating binary patches and differences between them, please check libxdiff website. this extension uses libxdiff to implement these functions. please see http://www.xmailserver.org/xdiff-lib.html for more information. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.dio.html">Direct IO</a></strong> — <small>PHP supports the direct io functions as described in the Posix Standard (Section 6) for performing I/O functions at a lower level than the C-Language stream I/O functions (fopen(), fread(),..). The use of the DIO functions should be considered only when direct control of a device is needed. In all other cases, the standard filesystem functions are more than adequate. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.inotify.html">Inotify</a></strong> — <small>The inotify extension exposes the inotify functions inotify_init(), inotify_add_watch() and inotify_rm_watch(). As the C inotify_init() function returns a file descriptor, PHP's inotify_init() returns a stream resource, usable with standard stream functions, like stream_select(), stream_set_blocking() and fclose(). inotify_read() replaces the C way of reading inotify events. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.proctitle.html">Proctitle</a></strong> — <small>This extension allows changing the current process', and thread, name on Linux and *BSD systems. This is useful when using pcntl_fork() to identify running processes in process list </small></li>

		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.xmlreader.html">XMLReader</a></strong> — <small>The XMLReader extension is an XML Pull parser. The reader acts as a cursor going forward on the document stream and stopping at each node on the way. It is important to note that internally, libxml uses the UTF-8 encoding and as such, the encoding of the retrieved contents will always be in UTF-8 encoding. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.xmlwriter.html">XMLWriter</a></strong> — <small>This is the XMLWriter extension. It wraps the libxml xmlWriter API. This extension represents a writer that provides a non-cached, forward-only means of generating streams or files containing XML data. This extension can be used in an object oriented style or a procedural one. Every method documented describes the alternative procedural call. </small></li>

It is a standard defined by The World Wide Web consortium (W3C). Information about XML and related technologies can be found at http://www.w3.org/XML/. This PHP extension implements support for James Clark's expat in PHP. This toolkit lets you parse, but not validate, XML documents. It supports three source character encodings also provided by PHP: US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8. UTF-16 is not supported. This extension lets you create XML parsers and then define handlers for different XML events. Each XML parser also has a few parameters you can adjust. </small></li>

Currently this extension only supports the Sablotron library from the Ginger Alliance. Support is planned for other libraries, such as the Xalan library or the libxslt library. XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Transformations) is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents. It is a standard defined by The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Information about XSLT and related technologies can be found at » http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt. This extension is different than the sablotron extension distributed with versions of PHP prior to PHP 4.1.0, currently only the new XSLT extension in PHP 4.1.0 is supported. If you need support for the old extension, please ask your questions on the PHP mailing lists. This extension has been moved to the PECL repository and is no longer bundled with PHP as of PHP 5.0.0. If you need xslt support with PHP 5 you can use the XSL extension. </small></li>

		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.sdo.html">SDO</a></strong> — <small>Service Data Objects. 
			<ul>
			    <li>		    Service Data Objects (SDOs) enable PHP applications to work with data from different sources (like a database query, an XML file, and a spreadsheet) using a single interface.</li>
			    <li>		    Each different kind of data source requires a Data Access Service (DAS) to provide access to the data in the data source. In your PHP application, you use a DAS to create an SDO instance that represents some data in the data source. You can then set and get values in the SDO instance using the standard SDO interface. Finally, you use a DAS to write the modified data back to a data source, typically the same one.</li>
			    <li>		    See the list of Data Access Services for details on those currently available. In addition to the provided DASs, SDO also provides interfaces to enable others to be implemented (see the section on SDO Data Access Services Interface for more details).</li>
			    <li>		    This extension is derived from concepts taken from the » Service Data Objects specification. It includes a version of the » Apache Tuscany SDO for C++ project.</li>
			</ul>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Structure of a Service Data Object
			<ul>
			    <li>A Service Data Object instance is made up of a tree of data objects. The tree is defined by containment relationships between the data objects. For example, a Company data object might consist of a number of Department data objects and therefore the Company would have a containment relationship to the Departments.</li>
			    <li>An SDO may also have non-containment references between data objects in the tree. For example, one Employee data object might reference another Employee to identify a career mentor.</li>
			    <li>As well as data objects referencing each other, they can also have primitive properties. For example, the Company data object might have a property called "name" of type string, for holding the name of the company (for example, "Acme").</li>
			    <li>Each of these properties of a data object - containment relationships, non-containment references, or primitive properties - may be many-valued or single-valued. In the above examples, Departments is many-valued and the Company name is single-valued.</li>
			    <li>In PHP, each SDO data object is represented as a PHP object. The properties of the data object can be accessed using either object syntax or associative array syntax. We'll see some examples of this later.</li>
			</ul>
		    </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>E&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.sdodasrel.html">SDO-DAS-Relational</a></strong> — <small>SDO Relational Data Access Service. 
			<ul>
			    <li>In order to use the Relational Data Access Service for Service Data Objects, you will need to understand some of the concepts behind SDO: the data graph, the data object, the disconnected way of working, the change summary, XPath and property expressions, and so on. If you are not familiar with these ideas, you might want to look first at the section on SDO. In addition, the Relational DAS makes use of the PDO extension to isolate itself from specifics of different back-end relational databases. In order to use the Relational DAS you will need to be able to create and pass a PDO database connection; for this reason you might also want to take a look at the section on PDO.</li>
			    <li>The job of the Relational DAS is to move data between the application and a relational database. In order to do this it needs to be told the mapping between the database entities - tables, columns, primary keys and foreign keys - and the elements of the SDO model - types, properties, containment relationships and so on. You specify this information as metadata when you construct the Relational DAS.</li>
			</ul>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview of Operation
			<ul>
			    <li>The first step is to call the Relational DAS's constructor, passing the metadata that defines the mapping between database and SDO model. There are examples of this below.</li>
			    <li>The next step might be to call the executeQuery() or executePreparedQuery() methods on the Relational DAS, passing either a literal SQL statement for the DAS to prepare and execute, or a prepared statement with placeholders and a list of values to be inserted. You may also need to specify a small amount of metadata about the query itself, so that the Relational DAS knows exactly what columns will be returned from the database and in what order. You will also need to pass a PDO database connection.</li>
			    <li>The return value from executeQuery() or executePreparedQuery() is a normalised data graph containing all the data from the result set. For a query that returns data obtained from a number of tables, this graph will contain a number of data objects, linked by SDO containment relationships. There may also be SDO non-containment references within the data.</li>
			    <li>Once the query has been executed and the data graph constructed, there is no need for either that instance of the Relational DAS or the database connection. There are no locks held on the database. Both the Relational DAS and the PDO database connection can be garbage collected.</li>
			    <li>Quite possibly the data in the data graph will go through a number of modifications. The data graph can be serialised into the PHP session and so may have a lifetime beyond just one client-server interaction. Data objects can be created and added to the graph, the data objects already in the graph can be deleted, and data objects in the graph can be modified.</li>
			    <li>Finally, the changes made to the data graph can be applied back to the database using the applyChanges() method of the Relational DAS. For this, another instance of the Relational DAS must be constructed, using the same metadata, and another connection to the database obtained. The connection and the data graph are passed to applyChanges(). At this point the Relational DAS examines the change summary and generates the necessary INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE SQL statements to apply the changes. Any UPDATE and DELETE statements are qualified with the original values of the data so that should the data have changed in the database in the meantime this will be detected. Assuming no such collisions have occurred the changes will be committed to the database. The application can then continue to work with the data graph, make more changes and apply them, or can discard it.</li>
			    <li>There are other ways of working with the data in the database: it is possible to just create data objects and write them to the database without a preliminary call to executeQuery(), for example. This scenario and others are explored in the Examples section below. </li>

In order to use the XML Data Access Service for Service Data Objects, you will need to understand some of the concepts behind SDO: the data graph, the data object, XPath and property expressions, and so on. If you are not familiar with these ideas, you might want to look first at the section on SDO. The job of the XML DAS is to move data between the application and an XML data source, which can be either a file or a URL. SDOs are always created and maintained according to a model which defines type names and what property names each type may have. For data which is from XML, this SDO model is built from a schema file written in XML schema language (an xsd file). This schema file is usually passed to the create method when the XMLDAS is initialised. The SDO 2.0 specification defines the mapping between XML types and SDO types. There are a number of small limitations in the PHP support - not everything which is in the specification can be done - and these limitations are summarised in a later section. </small></li>

		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.domxml.html">DOM XML (PHP 4)</a></strong> — <small>The DOM XML extension has been overhauled in PHP 4.3.0 to better comply with the DOM standard. The extension still contains many old functions, but they should no longer be used. In particular, functions that are not object-oriented should be avoided. The extension allows you to operate on an XML document with the DOM API. It also provides a function domxml_xmltree() to turn the complete XML document into a tree of PHP objects. Currently, this tree should be considered read-only - you can modify it, but this would not make any sense since DomDocument_dump_mem() cannot be applied to it. Therefore, if you want to read an XML file and write a modified version, use DomDocument_create_element(), DomDocument_create_text_node(), set_attribute(), etc. and finally the DomDocument_dump_mem() function. This extension has been moved to the PECL repository and is no longer bundled with PHP as of PHP 5.0.0. This extension is no longer marked experimental. It will, however, never be released with PHP 5, and will only be distributed with PHP 4. If you need DOM XML support with PHP 5 you can use the DOM extension. This domxml extension is not compatible with the DOM extension. </small></li>

WDDX (Web Distributed Data eXchange) is a programming-language-, platform- and transport-neutral data interchange mechanism to pass data between different environments and different computers. It supports simple data types such as number, string, boolean, etc., and complex aggregates of these in forms such as structures, arrays and recordsets (row/column data, typically coming from database queries). There are WDDX interfaces for a wide variety of languages. ColdFusion, Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, C++, .NET, Actionscript, lisp, Haskell, Perl and various platforms support it very well. //The data is encoded into XML using an XML 1.0 DTD, producing a platform-independent but relatively bulky representation. The XML-encoded data can then be sent to another computer using HTTP, FTP, or other transmission mechanism. The receiving computer must have WDDX-aware software to translate the encoded data into the receiver's native data representation. WDDX can also be used to serialize data structures to storage (file system or database). Many applications use WDDX to pass complex data to browsers where it can be manipulated with JavaScript, as an alternative to JSON. //WDDX and XML-RPC, both created in 1998, were the precursors to SOAP and Web services. SOAP borrows the envelope/header/body structure and the transport + interaction neutrality from WDDX and the HTTP and RPC bindings from XML-RPC.</small></li>

This extension is compatible with any Version 0-9-1 compatible AMQP broker, such as » RabbitMQ and » OpenAMQ. This extension relies on the » librabbitmq RPC library for communicating with the AMQP broker. Though named "rabbit", this library is compatible with all Version 0-9-1 compatible AMQP brokers. We *HIGHLY* recommend you review the » AMQP specification reference, version 0-9-1. This document will help explain a lot of the calls made available by this extension. </small></li>

This extension allows php applications to communicate with any Stomp compliant Message Brokers through easy object oriented and procedural interfaces. STOMP is the Simple (or Streaming) Text Orientated Messaging Protocol. STOMP provides an interoperable wire format so that STOMP clients can communicate with any STOMP message broker to provide easy and widespread messaging interoperability among many languages, platforms and brokers. Simple Design. STOMP is a very simple and easy to implement protocol, coming from the HTTP school of design; the server side may be hard to implement well, but it is very easy to write a client to get yourself connected. For example you can use Telnet to login to any STOMP broker and interact with it! Many developers have told us that they have managed to write a STOMP client in a couple of hours to in their particular language, runtime or platform into the STOMP network. So if your favored language/runtime of choice does not offer a good enough STOMP client don't be afraid to write one. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.sam.html">SAM</a></strong> — <small>Simple Asynchronous Messaging. This extension provides access to the functionality of messaging and queueing systems, such as the IBM WebSphere MQSeries family of products, from PHP scripts. The interface is designed to make it extremely simple to do the more commonly required tasks such as deliver simple text messages to queues while still allowing skilled users to do more complex messaging operations. For many users the complexities of setting up numerous options can be simply ignored. The SAM extension is a framework that provides a very simple API that can be used to access a number of messaging middleware systems. Currently the package includes built-in support for the MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) messaging protocol and support for the IBM Messaging and Queuing middleware products. SAM is designed to be readily extended to support other messaging systems and extension modules may be written in C or PHP. </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:green;color:white">P</font>E&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.sca.html">SCA</a></strong> — <small>SCA for PHP makes it possible for a PHP programmer to write reusable components, which can be called in a variety of ways, with an identical interface and with a minimum of fuss. At present components can call each other either locally or via Web services, but in the future it is expected that other ways will be possible. It provides the programmer with a way of doing this which will look as natural as possible in PHP. //SCA components use phpDocumentor-style (see http://www.phpdoc.org/) annotations to declare dependencies on other SCA components or Web services. The SCA for PHP runtime resolves these dependencies at runtime on behalf of the components, and thus allows the PHP programmer to focus on the business logic rather than on locating and obtaining references to dependencies. //The SCA for PHP programming model can be extended to support a number of service types, such as REST and Atompub. However, Web services (more accurately, WSDL defined, SOAP/HTTP services), are the only type currently specified. //Components also use annotations to define the interface which they expose as a service. The SCA for PHP runtime will automatically generate WSDL from these annotations, so that an SCA component is easily exposed as a web service. These annotations are a natural extension to those provided by phpDocumentor. Deploying a Web service can be as simple as placing a PHP component under the document root of a web server. //Components also use annotations to specify data structures (expressed using XML schema complex types) which are then handled using Service Data Objects (SDOs). //A PHP script which is not an SCA component and which contains no annotations can use the services of an SCA component. A PHP script or component can make calls to a web service that is not an SCA component, but using the same system of calls or annotations to obtain a reference. </small></li>

		    <ul>
			<li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.dba.html">DBA</a></strong> — <small>Database (dbm-style) Abstraction Layer. These functions build the foundation for accessing Berkeley DB style databases. This is a general abstraction layer for several file-based databases. As such, functionality is limited to a common subset of features supported by modern databases such as » Oracle Berkeley DB. </small></li>
			<li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.uodbc.html">ODBC</a></strong> — <small>ODBC (Unified). In addition to normal ODBC support, the Unified ODBC functions in PHP allow you to access several databases that have borrowed the semantics of the ODBC API to implement their own API. Instead of maintaining multiple database drivers that were all nearly identical, these drivers have been unified into a single set of ODBC functions. The following databases are supported by the Unified ODBC functions: » Adabas D, » IBM DB2, » iODBC, » Solid, and » Sybase SQL Anywhere. With the exception of iODBC, there is no ODBC involved when connecting to the above databases. The functions that you use to speak natively to them just happen to share the same names and syntax as the ODBC functions. However, building PHP with iODBC support enables you to use any ODBC-compliant drivers with your PHP applications. More information on iODBC, is available at » www.iodbc.org with the alternative unixODBC available at » www.unixodbc.org. </small></li>
			<li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.pdo.html">PDO</a></strong> — <small>PHP Data Objects. The PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension defines a lightweight, consistent interface for accessing databases in PHP. Each database driver that implements the PDO interface can expose database-specific features as regular extension functions. Note that you cannot perform any database functions using the PDO extension by itself; you must use a database-specific PDO driver to access a database server. PDO provides a data-access abstraction layer, which means that, regardless of which database you're using, you use the same functions to issue queries and fetch data. PDO does not provide a database abstraction; it doesn't rewrite SQL or emulate missing features. You should use a full-blown abstraction layer if you need that facility. PDO ships with PHP 5.1, and is available as a PECL extension for PHP 5.0; PDO requires the new OO features in the core of PHP 5, and so will not run with earlier versions of PHP.

		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.mbstring.html">Multibyte String</a></strong> — <small>While there are many languages in which every necessary character can be represented by a one-to-one mapping to an 8-bit value, there are also several languages which require so many characters for written communication that they cannot be contained within the range a mere byte can code (A byte is made up of eight bits. Each bit can contain only two distinct values, one or zero. Because of this, a byte can only represent 256 unique values (two to the power of eight)). Multibyte character encoding schemes were developed to express more than 256 characters in the regular bytewise coding system. //When you manipulate (trim, split, splice, etc.) strings encoded in a multibyte encoding, you need to use special functions since two or more consecutive bytes may represent a single character in such encoding schemes. Otherwise, if you apply a non-multibyte-aware string function to the string, it probably fails to detect the beginning or ending of the multibyte character and ends up with a corrupted garbage string that most likely loses its original meaning. //mbstring provides multibyte specific string functions that help you deal with multibyte encodings in PHP. In addition to that, mbstring handles character encoding conversion between the possible encoding pairs. mbstring is designed to handle Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UCS-2 and many single-byte encodings for convenience (listed below). </small></li>
		    <li><strong><font style="background-color:blue;color:white">B</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="php-chunked-xhtml/book.iconv.html">iconv</a></strong> — <small>This module contains an interface to iconv character set conversion facility. With this module, you can turn a string represented by a local character set into the one represented by another character set, which may be the Unicode character set. Supported character sets depend on the iconv implementation of your system. Note that the iconv function on some systems may not work as you expect. In such case, it'd be a good idea to install the GNU libiconv library. It will most likely end up with more consistent results. Since PHP 5.0.0, this extension comes with various utility functions that help you to write multilingual scripts. Let's have a look at the following sections to explore the new features. </small></li>

The GNU Recode library converts files between various coded character sets and surface encodings. When this cannot be achieved exactly, it may get rid of the offending characters or fall back on approximations. The library recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able to convert files between almost any pair. Most RFC1345 character sets are supported. </small></li>

And also can be used to spot sql injection vulnerabilities, and shell inject, etc. When taint is enabled, if you pass a tainted string(comes from $_GET, $_POST or $_COOKIE) to some functions, taint will warn you about that. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in Web applications, such as web browsers through breaches of browser security, that enables attackers to inject client-side script into Web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 80.5% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007.[1] Their effect may range from a petty nuisance to a significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner.</small></li>

Session support in PHP consists of a way to preserve certain data across subsequent accesses. This enables you to build more customized applications and increase the appeal of your web site. A visitor accessing your web site is assigned a unique id, the so-called session id. This is either stored in a cookie on the user side or is propagated in the URL. The session support allows you to store data between requests in the $_SESSION superglobal array. When a visitor accesses your site, PHP will check automatically (if session.auto_start is set to 1) or on your request (explicitly through session_start() or implicitly through session_register()) whether a specific session id has been sent with the request. If this is the case, the prior saved environment is recreated. </small></li>
